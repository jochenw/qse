### The DisabledStepsRule

This rule checks, whether flow services contain one, or more, disabled steps.
Obviously, disabled steps are a clear indication of uncompleted code. As such,
they should only be present in code, that is currently under development, and
never in code, that is ready for production.

Obviously, this is a fairly simple rule, so it doesn't have any properties.
You may enable, or disable the rule, and you may set the rules severity, but
that's about it.
